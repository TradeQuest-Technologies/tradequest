Terms of Service

Last updated: September 28, 2025

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding agreement between Tradequest Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation, d/b/a TradeQuest (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you (“you” or “User”). By accessing or using our websites, apps, APIs, or related services (collectively, the “Service”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

1) What we do (educational software; not a broker)

We provide subscription software for trade journaling, analytics, backtesting, and AI-assisted reviews via read-only broker integrations (the “Platform”). We do not provide investment, legal, tax, accounting, or other professional advice, and we are not a broker-dealer, investment adviser, exchange, ATS, or money transmitter. The Service is educational and for information only.

2) Eligibility; accounts; security

Age. You must be 16+ to use the Service. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only with parent/guardian consent and where permitted by law.

Account security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials, enabling 2FA, and all activity under your account. Notify us promptly of unauthorized use.

Accuracy. You agree your registration and profile information is accurate and kept updated.

3) Subscriptions; billing; refunds

Charge timing. Paid plans are billed at checkout (monthly or annual) in USD via our payment processor (e.g., Stripe). Taxes may apply.

Auto-renewal & cancellation. Subscriptions renew until canceled in your Account. Cancellation stops future renewals; it doesn’t refund time already used unless our refund policy applies.

Refund policy (baseline). First-time purchases are refundable within 7 days upon request to support@tradequest.tech
. Renewals are generally non-refundable except where required by law.

Price/features changes. We may change prices or features prospectively; we’ll notify you before changes affecting your next renewal.

4) Strict “no advice” + risk disclosures

No advice or recommendations. Content, analytics, and AI outputs are not investment advice or a solicitation to buy/sell any security, digital asset, or instrument.

No guarantees. Backtests and simulations are hypothetical and may differ materially from actual results. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Your risk. Trading involves risk, including total loss. You alone are responsible for your trades and outcomes.

5) Broker connections; data sources

Read-only keys only. Integrations require read-only API keys. Never grant withdrawal/transfer permissions. You are responsible for key management.

Third parties. Broker APIs, market data, and third-party services are outside our control and may be inaccurate, delayed, incomplete, or unavailable.

No execution. We do not place, route, or execute orders.

6) Acceptable use

You agree not to: (a) use the Service for unlawful purposes or market abuse; (b) violate third-party terms or IP rights; (c) scrape at scale or reverse engineer; (d) circumvent security or plan limits; (e) upload malware or unlawful content; (f) attempt to access others’ accounts or data. We may suspend or terminate access for violations or to protect the Service and users.

7) Ownership; your license to use

We and our licensors own the Service (software, designs, data excluding your content). Subject to these Terms and payment of fees, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Service for personal or internal business educational use.

8) Your content; license to us

You retain rights to content you upload (e.g., trade logs, notes, files). You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, analyze, display, and create derivative insights solely to operate and improve the Service; comply with law; and enforce these Terms. You represent you have rights to your content.

9) AI features; model outputs

AI may produce inaccurate or offensive outputs. Verify results before relying on them. You are responsible for how you use AI outputs. We may use anonymized telemetry to improve quality only if you opt in (see Privacy Policy).

10) Beta/preview features

Alpha/beta features may be unstable or changed/removed. Use at your sole risk.

11) Feedback

If you give feedback, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use it without restriction or compensation.

12) Privacy

Our Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference and explains how we collect, use, and share data.

13) Third-party links/services

We are not responsible for third-party websites, services, or terms.

14) Export & sanctions

You will not use the Service in violation of export-control or sanctions laws and represent you are not located in, or a resident of, embargoed or sanctioned jurisdictions (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea/Donetsk/Luhansk regions of Ukraine) or otherwise on a restricted list.

15) Disclaimers

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY (INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY). WE DO NOT WARRANT RESULTS, ANALYTICS, OR AI OUTPUTS WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

16) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOST PROFITS/REVENUE/GOODWILL/DATA; OR TRADING LOSSES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 6 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS LIMIT SUCH EXCLUSIONS; IN THOSE, WE LIMIT LIABILITY TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED. NOTHING LIMITS LIABILITY FOR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD.

17) Indemnification

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content, your breach of these Terms, or violation of law/third-party rights.

18) Term; termination

We may suspend or terminate access at any time to protect users or the Service, or for material violations. You may stop using the Service at any time. Sections that by nature should survive (ownership, disclaimers, limits, indemnity, disputes) survive termination.

19) Changes

We may change the Service or these Terms. If changes are material, we will notify you (e.g., email or in-app). Continued use after the effective date means acceptance.

20) Governing law; venue
